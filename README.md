A simple and configurable toast framework written in Swift.

## Installation

ToastFrameworkSwift is an open-source framework available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

First step is to install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). Skip this step if you already have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) installed on your machine.

```ruby
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Initialize your project with Cocoapods from your project directory:

```ruby
pod init
```

For installation, add the required pod within your `Podfile` as shown below:

```ruby
pod 'ToastFrameworkSwift'
```

After adding the pod, run the below command :

```ruby
pod install
```

## ToastFrameworkSwift Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` within the ToastFrameworkExample directory, using `Terminal`. 

Here you can see how different types of toasts look, both normal and CTA ones.

## Usage

After the installation step you should have generated the `.xcworkspace`. The next step now is to import `ToastFrameworkSwift` within your `ViewController`:

```swift
import ToastFrameworkSwift
```

A simple and configurable toast framework written in Swift.

## Installation

ToastFrameworkSwift is an open-source framework available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

First, initialize your project with Cocoapods (install Cocoapods prior to this if you do not have it installed on your machine):

```ruby
pod init
```

For installation, add the required pod within your `Podfile` as shown below:

```ruby
pod 'ToastFrameworkSwift'
```

After adding the pod, run the below command :

```ruby
pod install
```

## ToastFrameworkSwift Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` within the ToastFrameworkExample directory, using `Terminal`. 

Here you can see how different types of toasts look, both normal and CTA ones.

## Usage

After the installation step you should have generated the `.xcworkspace`. The next step now is to import `ToastFrameworkSwift` within your `ViewController`:

```swift
import ToastFrameworkSwift
```
